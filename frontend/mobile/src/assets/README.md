# Asset Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for assets that would be used in the Travel Buddy application.

## Required Assets

The following assets need to be replaced with actual image files:

1. **logo.png** - The Travel Buddy logo used throughout the app
2. **avatar.png** - Default user avatar image

## Instructions

Replace these placeholder files with actual image assets before building the application. The recommended specifications are:

- **logo.png**: 512x512px, transparent background
- **avatar.png**: 200x200px, circular image with transparent background

## Note

In a real application, you would also need to include different resolution versions of these assets for different device densities (e.g., @2x, @3x for iOS or hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi for Android).
